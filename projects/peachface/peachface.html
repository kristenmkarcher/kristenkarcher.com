                        <h1>What is Peachface Cosmetics?</h1>
                        <p>Peachface Cosmetics is a website that introduces users to high-quality makeup products. I designed this site to be easy to navigate,
                            with the most sought after products readily accesible for purchase.<br><br>
                            The idea for Peachface was inspired from various frustrations I have had navigating other retail websites, and of course, my love of cosmetics.

                        Through email and social media, my survey was completed by 20 different respondents. Below are my findings.

Urban Decay also offers the user to checkout with Shoprunner, which guarantees free shipping and returns, as well as 2-day delivery. Each of the websites also allow the user to sign in using a social media account instead of creating an account or checking out as a guest.</p>

As for the color palette, I was inspired by bright, feminine pinks with contrasting brown and berry shades. I wanted the font for the logo to look elegant, yet fun and playful. Along with these ideas, my logo would not have been complete without the image of a peach.</p>

                            <p>After creating a preference test for the final design, it was decided option B would ultimately be the choice. The pop of blue from the water in the image on option B was a nice contrast to the rest of the colors on the page. The pink bars on the top navigation were also made smaller, and the background color on the navigation was made a lighter shade of pink to make each feature stand out a bit more.</p>

                            <p>As this was the first project I designed on my own, there were many things I learned going through this process. Through the design process, I greatly increased my abilities with Sketch and the Adobe suite. Researching user feedback also provided many benefits through the design process. While I initially had many conceptions as to what made a great site, the insight gained through user surveys and personas allowed me to make beneficial changes to my overall design.</p>
