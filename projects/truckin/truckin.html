                        <h1>What is Truckin' Delicious?</h1>
                        <p>Truckin' Delicious is a mobile app that allows users to search, order, and purchase from food trucks in their area. Users can discover new dining options hidden in their areas. Truckin' Delicious gives users a chance to connect with smaller locally owned food trucks.<br><br>
                            The idea for Truckin' Delicious came from observing my local food truck scene. Everyday, dozens of trucks gather in a nearby town with little advertising, other than social media and word of mouth. I invision Truckin' Delicious to be a way for businesses like these to advertise to a larger audience.

                            <p>Truckin' Delicious is trying to solve the issue of "what do I eat today?" Too often, people rely on the same food choices, rarely being exposed to the new and delicious options in their area. Truckin' Delicious allows users to search a variety of local cuisines that may be hidden right under their noses.

                        <p>I wanted to analyze a few top food apps based on how they allow users to search for meal options and pay for them. I chose to compare Eat24 and Grubhub while developing my concept. Eat24 and Grubhub both allow the user to search for food by specific item, cuisine, restaurant, price and if they offer delivery. While selecting items to purchase, they offer detailed descriptions of each item and the option to add any "special instructions" to your order. For example, food allergies or "hold the onions". The checkout process is also similar for both apps. The user has the ability to select delivery or pickup, shows the delivery charge upfront, and gives the option to select an amount for tip. While they have many similarities, Eat24 and Grubhub differ in that Eat24 allows the user to view the profile and full menu of a restaurant, even if they are closed, and Grubhub does not.</p>

                            <p>The logo for Truckin' Delicious is inspired by the location pin on a map. My first experience with a food truck was going to a series of Mexican trucks in my neighboring city. Creating the pin with a taco serves as a reminder of this experience, along with symbolizing one of the most iconic food truck cuisines.<br><br>My choice of light green and blue again goes back to my first food truck experience.The first trucks I visited are lined up by the ocean, and these colors remind me of that location I still so often. I used the bright pink color as a callout to draw attention to small features in the app. The font I used for my logo reminded me of the ocean waves and brings about a feeling of summertime and eating a delicious lunch outside.</p>

                            <p>Truckin' Delicious allowed me to learn how to design specifically for a mobile application. Through this process, I learned how some design choices made on a desktop application do not work out as well on mobile devices. I had to focus on mobile usability, and not just the design of the app. This project taught me how to emphasize each truck with a limited amount of space, due to the size limitations of the device. This process was challenging, yet very fun and I enjoyed creating this app.</p>
